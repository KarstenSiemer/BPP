	\chapter*{Abstract}
	The focus of this work is on the automatic management of DNS zones and entries in a distributed multi-cloud microservices architecture.
	\medskip
	The goal is to relieve developers from manual tasks and enhance efficiency.
	\medskip
	The work includes the selection and implementation of a Kubernetes operator, the conceptualization of a DNS hierarchy,
	the security of public and private zones, the implementation of DNSSEC, and an infrastructure translation using Terraform.
	The project follows an iterative model, with weekly meetings ensuring organization.
	\medskip
	The results meet the requirements, have been successfully tested, and achieve the break-even point after four days,
	emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of the solution.
	The impact on developers is positive, as they can now deploy microservices on various cloud providers without manual DNS configuration.
	\medskip
	The conclusion demonstrates that automating the DNS infrastructure is a significant step towards efficiency and security.
