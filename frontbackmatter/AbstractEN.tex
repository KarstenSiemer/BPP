	\chapter*{Abstract}
	The focus of this work is on the automatic management of DNS zones and entries in a distributed multi-cloud microservices architecture.
	\medskip

    \noindent
	The goal is to relieve developers from manual tasks and enhance efficiency.
	\medskip

	\noindent
	The work includes the selection and implementation of a Kubernetes operator, the conceptualization of a DNS hierarchy,
	the security of public and private zones, the implementation of DNSSEC, and an infrastructure translation using Terraform.
	The project follows an iterative model, with weekly meetings ensuring organization.
	\medskip

	\noindent
	The results do meet the requirements and have been successfully tested, and achieve the break-even point after four days,
	emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of the solution.
	The impact on developers is very positive, as they can now deploy microservices on various cloud providers without manual DNS configuration.
	\medskip

	\noindent
	The conclusion shows that automating the DNS infrastructure is a significant step towards efficiency and security.
